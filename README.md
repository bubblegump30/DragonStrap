**v2.0.4 — Roblox Overview Status Polish**

DragonStrap is a Windows Roblox bootstrapper and launcher with a custom Purple Dragon UI/UX. v2.0.4 keeps the DragonStrap 2.0 architecture and makes the Home Roblox Overview present real build identifiers and status state instead of unlabeled GUID fragments or decorative percentage-style gauges.

## DragonStrap 2.0 architecture

- `AppKernel` owns service construction and dependency wiring instead of `main.js` creating services ad hoc.
- A sealed `ServiceRegistry` exposes explicit capabilities and contract versions for core services.
- `BootstrapPipeline` coordinates Roblox Player installation/rollback and DragonStrap self-update operations.
- `OperationCoordinator` prevents destructive install/update/recovery workflows from colliding.
- Core API version `2.0.0` is exposed through the preload boundary and Settings runtime panel.
- Plugin-ready extension points are defined for launch adapters, server enrichment, diagnostics, and profile sections.
- Third-party plugin code is **not executed in v2.0.0**; the extension boundary is ready without weakening the stable Electron security model.
- Roblox installation status reads use a short-lived main-process cache to reduce repeated filesystem scans.
- Heavy feature centers now lazy-load when opened instead of all loading during startup.

## Current centers

- Roblox Launch Center
- Roblox Installation & Update Engine
- Channel & Version Manager
- Update Center 2.0
- Performance Center 2.0
- FastFlag Manager 3.0
- Server Intelligence 2.0
- Studio Center 2.0
- Profiles & Configuration Center
- Reliability & Recovery 2.0

## Safety model

DragonStrap keeps privileged process/filesystem work in the main process. The renderer remains sandboxed with `contextIsolation` enabled and `nodeIntegration` disabled. Renderer calls are restricted to typed preload methods; arbitrary executable paths, shell commands, configuration paths, and third-party plugin code are not accepted.

Installation/update/recovery operations use one coordinated destructive-operation lock. Roblox package installation remains staged and validated before commit, self-updates remain SHA-256 verified, and recovery continues to use allowlisted locations and transactional restore behavior.

## Run from source

Requirements: Windows 10/11, Node.js, npm, and the Windows `tar.exe` utility used by the Roblox package engine.

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Source/dev mode intentionally disables binary self-application. Build a packaged release to exercise Portable or Setup update paths.

## Validation

```powershell
npm run check
npm test
npm run release:verify
```

## Windows release build

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-Windows-Release.ps1
```

Official releases should upload both Windows executables and the generated `dist\SHA256SUMS.txt` file.
